          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors
            at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with
            groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver an orphaned infant wizard named
            Harry Potter to his Muggle aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon
            Dursley, his only living relatives. Ten years later, just before
            Harry's eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed
            to him. When the abusive Dursleys adamantly refuse to allow Harry to
            open any and flee to an island hut, Hagrid arrives to personally
            deliver Harry's letter of acceptance to Hogwarts. Hagrid also
            reveals that Harry's parents, James and Lily, were killed by a dark
            wizard named Lord Voldemort. The killing curse that Voldemort had
            cast towards Harry rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and giving
            Harry his lightning-bolt scar. Hagrid then takes Harry to Diagon
            Alley for school supplies and gives him a pet snowy owl whom he
            names Hedwig. Harry buys a wand that is connected to Voldemort's own
            wand. At King's Cross station, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express
            train, and meets fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger
            during the journey. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry also meets Draco
            Malfoy, who is from a wealthy wizard family; the two immediately
            form a rivalry. The students assemble in the Great Hall where the
            Sorting Hat sorts the first-years into four respective houses:
            Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is placed
            into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione, while Draco is placed
            into Slytherin, a house noted for dark wizards. As he studies magic,
            Harry learns more about his parents and Voldemort, and his natural
            talent for broomstick flying gets him recruited for Gryffindor's
            Quidditch team as the youngest Seeker in a century. While returning
            to the Gryffindor common room, the staircases change paths, leading
            Harry, Ron and Hermione to the third floor, which is forbidden to
            students. There they discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy.
            On Halloween, Ron insults Hermione after she shows off in Charms
            class; upset, she spends the entire afternoon crying in the girls'
            bathroom. That evening, a giant marauding troll enters it, but Harry
            and Ron save Hermione, and the three make up and become close
            friends after Hermione takes the blame for the incident by claiming
            she went looking for the troll. The trio discover that Fluffy is
            guarding the philosopher's stone, a magical object that can turn
            metal into gold and produce an immortality elixir. Harry suspects
            that Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House, Severus Snape,
            wants the stone to return Voldemort to physical form. When Hagrid
            accidentally reveals that music puts Fluffy asleep, Harry, Ron and
            Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape. Fluffy is already
            asleep, but the trio face other barriers, including a deadly plant
            called Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and
            a giant chess game that knocks out Ron. After overcoming the
            barriers, Harry encounters Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher
            Quirinus Quirrell who wants the stone; Snape had figured it out and
            had been protecting Harry. Quirrell removes his turban to reveal a
            weakened Voldemort living on the back of his head. Dumbledore's
            protective enchantment places the stone in Harry's possession.
            Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for
            resurrecting his parents, but Harry sees through his trick and
            refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry. When Harry touches
            Quirrell's skin, it burns Quirrell, reducing him to ashes.
            Voldemort's soul rises from the pile and escapes, knocking out Harry
            as it passes through him. Harry recovers in the school infirmary.
            Dumbledore tells him the stone has been destroyed to prevent misuse,
            and that Ron and Hermione are safe. He also reveals how Harry
            defeated Quirrell: when Lily died to save Harry, a love-based
            protection against Voldemort was placed on him. At the
            end-of-school-year feast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded
            extra house points for their heroism, tying Gryffindor for first
            place with Slytherin; Dumbledore then awards ten points to their
            housemate Neville Longbottom for having had the courage to stand up
            to the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns to the
            Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home at
            Hogwarts

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Spending the summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter meets Dobby, a
            house-elf who warns him that it is dangerous to return to Hogwarts.
            Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock up
            Harry to prevent his return to Hogwarts. Harry's friend Ron Weasley
            and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father's flying
            car. In Diagon Alley, Harry, the Weasleys and Hermione Granger
            notice a book-signing by Gilderoy Lockhart, Hogwarts' new Defence
            Against the Dark Arts teacher. There, Harry sees Draco Malfoy's
            father, Lucius, slip a book into Ginny Weasley's cauldron. After
            being blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at
            King's Cross railway station, Harry and Ron take the car to
            Hogwarts. There, they crash into the Whomping Willow, breaking Ron's
            wand, and receive detention. In detention, Harry hears a strange
            voice and later finds caretaker Argus Filch's cat, Mrs Norris,
            petrified beside a message written in blood: "The Chamber of Secrets
            has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware." One of Hogwarts'
            founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber
            containing a monster that only his heir can control, capable of
            purging the school of Muggle-born students. To solve this mystery,
            Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question Malfoy, using polyjuice
            potion, which they brew in a bathroom haunted by Moaning Myrtle, a
            ghost. During a Quidditch game, Harry's arm is broken by a rogue
            Bludger. Dobby visits him in the infirmary and reveals that he
            closed the barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and made the
            Bludger chase Harry to force him to leave the school. He also
            reveals that the Chamber had been opened in the past. When Harry
            communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the heir.
            Disguised as two of Malfoy's friends, Harry and Ron learn he is not
            the heir, but come to know that a Muggle-born girl died when the
            Chamber was last opened. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by
            former student Tom Riddle, who opened the Chamber and blamed Rubeus
            Hagrid, leading to his expulsion. When the diary is stolen and
            Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. Professor
            Dumbledore, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and Lucius arrive to
            take Hagrid to Azkaban, but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow
            the spiders". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's
            giant pet spider, Aragog, who reveals Hagrid's innocence. A book
            page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a basilisk, a
            giant serpent that kills people who make direct eye contact with it;
            the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff
            learns Ginny has been taken into the Chamber, and nominate Lockhart
            to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart preparing to flee, exposing
            him as a fraud. Deducing that Myrtle was the Muggle-born girl that
            the basilisk killed, they find the Chamber's entrance in the
            bathroom she haunts. Once inside, Lockhart tries to stop Harry and
            Ron by using a memory charm. However, because he seized Ron's broken
            wand, the spell backfires, erasing Lockhart's memory and causing a
            cave-in that separates Harry from Ron and Lockhart. Harry enters the
            Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle
            turns out to be Slytherin's heir and Voldemort's younger self. He
            used the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber. After
            Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, the latter's pet phoenix
            Fawkes arrives with the Sorting Hat, causing Riddle to summon the
            basilisk. Fawkes blinds the basilisk, and the Sorting Hat produces
            the Sword of Gryffindor, with which Harry battles the basilisk.
            After a struggle, he kills it but is poisoned by one of its fangs.
            Despite his injury, Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang,
            destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Fawkes' tears heal Harry, who
            returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart, earning
            Dumbledore's praise and Hagrid's release. Harry accuses Lucius,
            Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and
            tricks him into freeing Dobby. The basilisk's victims are healed,
            Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from
            Azkaban

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Harry Potter spends another dissatisfying summer with the Dursleys.
            On his thirteenth birthday, Vernon's visiting sister Marge viciously
            insults Harry and his parents, and an angry Harry causes her to
            inflate and float away. Expecting to be expelled for using magic
            outside school, Harry flees with his belongings. The Knight Bus
            takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where Minister for Magic
            Cornelius Fudge assures Harry that he will not be punished.
            Reuniting with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger,
            Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of Lord
            Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban Prison and intends to kill him.
            During the journey to Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express is boarded by
            Dementors, ghostly prison guards searching for Black. One enters
            Harry's compartment, causing him to faint, but new Defense Against
            the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin repels it with a Patronus Charm.
            At Hogwarts, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that Dementors
            will patrol the school until Black is captured. Rubeus Hagrid is
            appointed Care of Magical Creatures teacher, but his first class
            goes awry when Draco Malfoy provokes a Hippogriff named Buckbeak
            into attacking him, and his father, Lucius, has Buckbeak sentenced
            to death. Returning to Gryffindor Tower, the students find the Fat
            Lady's portrait has been attacked, and the terrified Fat Lady warns
            Dumbledore that Black entered the castle. During a stormy Quidditch
            match, Dementors cause Harry to fall off his broomstick, which is
            destroyed by the Whomping Willow. He is caught trying to visit
            Hogsmeade by Fred and George, who give him the Marauder's Map. Using
            the map, Harry sneaks into Hogsmeade and learns that Black is his
            godfather, but divulged the Potters' whereabouts to Voldemort and
            murdered their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew. Determined to ward off
            the Dementors, Harry convinces Lupin to teach him the Patronus
            Charm. After Divination class, he witnesses Professor Trelawney
            enter a trance and prophesies that the Dark Lord will return.
            Watching Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat Scabbers bites him and
            escapes, but a large black dog drags them both into a hole at the
            base of the Whomping Willow. This leads the trio through an
            underground passage into the Shrieking Shack, where the dog is
            revealed to be Black, an Animagus who can transform into an animal.
            Lupin appears, embracing Black as an old friend before revealing
            himself to be a werewolf. Snape arrives to apprehend Black, but is
            knocked out by Harry's Disarming spell. Lupin and Black reveal that
            Scabbers is actually the Animagus form of Pettigrew, who betrayed
            Harry's parents, faked his death and framed Black for his own
            crimes. Turning Pettigrew back into human form, the group heads back
            to the castle, but the full moon causes Lupin to transform and
            Pettigrew escapes. As Black fights off Lupin in their animal forms,
            Dementors attack Black and Harry, but an unseen figure casts a
            powerful Patronus. Harry falls unconscious, awakening in the
            infirmary with Dumbledore and Hermione. Learning that Black has been
            captured and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss, Harry and Hermione
            act on Dumbledore's advice and use Hermione's Time-Turner, which she
            was given to attend several classes at once, to go three hours back
            in time. They see themselves reliving the night's events, and set
            Buckbeak free from execution. Spotting the past Harry and Black
            being attacked by Dementors, Harry rescues them using a Patronus
            charm and realizes he was the unseen figure who saved them earlier.
            He and Hermione free Black, who flies away on Buckbeak, still a
            fugitive without proof of his innocence. Harry and Hermione return
            to the infirmary, rejoining their own timeline. Exposed as a
            werewolf, Lupin resigns from teaching and returns the Marauder's Map
            to Harry. Black sends Harry a Firebolt broomstick, which he happily
            takes on a ride.

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Over the summer, the Weasleys invite Harry Potter to attend the
            Quidditch World Cup final, played between Bulgaria and the Republic
            of Ireland. The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the
            campsite is attacked by Voldemort's former followers called the
            Death Eaters. Nobody is killed, but the Dark Mark is set off and
            found to have been cast by Barty Crouch's house-elf, Winky. Hogwarts
            reopens and a new tournament is announced between three schools to
            compete for the Triwizard Cup. The other competing schools are
            Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Students excitedly await the start of
            the Tournament, which is declared open after the visiting teams
            arrive. The Goblet of Fire, a magical object tasked with selecting
            the champions, is unveiled. It names three champions from each of
            the schools, then selects Harry as a fourth champion, despite him
            being underage. The students perceive Harry has cheated and turn on
            him. Rubeus Hagrid believes Harry's innocence and shows him the
            dragons involved in the First Task. Harry alerts Cedric Diggory, son
            of Amos Diggory, to the challenge and is helped by "Mad-Eye" Moody,
            ex-Auror and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, to
            prepare for the task. Using his superior flying skills, Harry gets
            past the dragon and retrieves a clue for the next task. A Yule Ball
            is announced and Harry must find a partner, as champions
            traditionally commence the opening dance. Harry and Ron Weasley
            struggle initially to get partners, but end up going with the
            "prettiest girls in their year" - Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron gets
            jealous seeing Hermione Granger with Viktor Krum, the Durmstrang
            champion, and spends the night arguing with her. Harry is sullen
            that Cho Chang is with Cedric, the other Hogwarts champion. The
            Second Task requires saving a close friend or relative from the
            lake. Harry uses Gillyweed, given to him by Dobby, to breathe
            underwater. He rescues Ron from the lake, while also saving the
            Beauxbatons champion, Fleur Delacour's sister, to pick up additional
            points. After the task, Harry and Krum discover Barty Crouch's dead
            body, but it has vanished when they return. The Quidditch field is
            prepared for the Third (and final) Task, and requires champions to
            overcome a maze filled with obstacles. Harry and Cedric succeed in
            reaching the centre, where the Triwizard Cup is placed. They touch
            it together, but are transported outside Hogwarts to a graveyard.
            Cedric believes this is part of the Task, but Harry gets alerted
            when his scar starts burning wildly. Wormtail arrives with Voldemort
            and kills Cedric with the latter's wand. He then uses Harry's blood
            to restore a frail Voldemort back to his full, physical body.
            Voldemort summons his Death Eaters and tries to kill Harry in front
            of them. He fails when his and Harry's wandstreams connect, in a
            rare phenomenon, called Priori Incantatem. This causes a
            distraction, allowing Harry to escape back to Hogwarts using the
            Cup. At Hogwarts, Moody pulls Harry into his office to question him
            and Harry realises that he is a Death Eater. He is saved by the
            arrival of Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape, who force Moody to
            reveal himself to be Barty Crouch Jr, a Death Eater formerly
            presumed dead. Crouch Jr had imprisoned the real Moody and
            impersonated him using Polyjuice Potion. Arriving at Hogwarts, he
            made sure that Harry won the Tournament and was transported to the
            graveyard for Voldemort's ritual. His father was under the Imperious
            Curse, but had started to resist it and so had been killed. Crouch
            Jr is handed over to the Dementors. Harry recovers in the hospital
            wing, surrounded by Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys. He meets with
            Cedric's grieving parents, while Dumbledore makes plans to prepare
            the wizarding world for Voldemort's return. The school year ends and
            Harry returns to live with the Dursleys again for the summer.

            During the summer, Harry Potter is left frustrated by his lack of
            involvement in Dumbledore's efforts to combat a newly-resurgent Lord
            Voldemort. One evening, he is attacked by Dementors, causing a group
            of wizards belonging to the Order of the Phoenix to evacuate him
            from the Dursley residence. They whisk him off to Number 12,
            Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's childhood home, which is now
            headquarters for the Order. Harry learns from Ron and Hermione that
            the Order is a secret organisation created by Dumbledore dedicated
            to fighting Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry wants to join, but
            Ron's mother Molly disapproves. Harry is the target of a
            Ministry-led smear campaign, under Cornelius Fudge, to malign him
            for stating that Voldemort has returned. Dolores Umbridge, a senior
            Ministry employee, becomes the new Defence Against the Dark Arts
            teacher at Hogwarts. She initiates strict rules and a textbook-only
            approach, forbidding practice of defensive spells by students. This
            leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form their own Defence group with
            other students called Dumbledore's Army, who secretly meet in the
            Room of Requirement to practise under Harry's instruction. One
            night, Harry has a vision of Arthur Weasley being attacked by
            Voldemort's snake, Nagini, which turns out to be true. Arthur is
            rescued, but Dumbledore realises that Harry's and Voldemort's minds
            are connected. He arranges for Professor Snape to teach Harry
            Occlumency, a skill where one closes their mind against others.
            Umbridge is tipped-off about Dumbledore's Army; to prevent Harry's
            expulsion for forming a secret organization, Dumbledore takes
            responsibility for the group, then goes into hiding to evade arrest.
            Umbridge is appointed headmistress. Harry's Occlumency lessons go
            poorly. During exams, he has a vision of Sirius being tortured by
            Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry. While
            trying to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place, Harry is caught by
            Umbridge using her office's Floo Network. She questions Harry and
            threatens to use the Cruciatus Curse on him. Hermione intervenes,
            and concocts a story that leads them into the Forbidden Forest.
            Umbridge provokes the centaurs there and they take her captive.
            Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna, fly to the Ministry
            to save Sirius, but he is not to be found inside the Department of
            Mysteries. Instead, the room is filled with shelves of glass
            spheres, one of which bears Harry's name along with Voldemort. Harry
            picks it up, and is immediately surrounded by Death Eaters. Lucius
            Malfoy reveals that Harry was tricked there by a fake vision from
            Voldemort, and that he wishes to hear the prophecy contained in the
            glass sphere. He asks Harry for the sphere, but Harry refuses. The
            Hogwarts group fight against the Death Eaters and evade them, aided
            by the arrival of the Order members. Neville accidentally drops and
            breaks the prophecy, and Sirius ends up dying at the hands of
            Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry chases after Bellatrix. Voldemort arrives
            and tries to kill Harry, but is thwarted by Dumbledore. Ministry of
            Magic employees arrive; they spot Voldemort just before he escapes
            with Bellatrix, and Fudge is forced to accept his return. In his
            office, Dumbledore explains to Harry that the prophecy was made by
            Professor Trelawney, and predicted the birth of a child with power
            against Voldemort. This had caused Voldemort to pursue Harry's
            parents, and is the reason he continues to target Harry. Overwhelmed
            by the prophecy and mourning the loss of Sirius, Harry grows sullen,
            although the wizarding community now affords him great respect.
            Motivated by his friends, Harry returns to the Dursleys

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Following the death of his godfather, Sirius Black, Harry is visited
            by Dumbledore, who escorts him to the home of the Weasleys. They
            take a detour to meet Horace Slughorn, whom Dumbledore wishes to
            return to Hogwarts school to teach Potions. Slughorn is reluctant
            but agrees after realising he will teach the famous Harry Potter. At
            Hogwarts, Severus Snape is announced as the new Defence Against the
            Dark Arts instructor. Harry, who had neglected to buy Potions
            supplies, must borrow an old textbook to attend Slughorn's class. He
            finds an old, tattered book bearing the inscription 'The Half-Blood
            Prince.' Harry notices that the scribbled tips inside the book yield
            better results than the printed instruction and continues to use the
            book afterward. He rises to the top of the class, with Slughorn
            attributing his Potions skill to be a trait inherited from his
            mother Lily. Meanwhile, Dumbledore educates Harry about the past of
            Tom Riddle, aka Voldemort, to prepare him for their foretold battle.
            He shows Harry memories of Riddle's past, including his parents
            meeting, one of his first murders and Dumbledore meeting him. One of
            Slughorn when he was a professor, but after Riddle says 'horcrux'
            the memory becomes dark. The memory has been altered, and Dumbledore
            wants Harry to retrieve the real one from Slughorn. Harry begins
            attending meetings of the Slug Club, an informal group of Slughorn's
            favourite students. Hermione and Ginny are also invited, though Ron
            is excluded. Hermione asks Ron to go to Slughorn's Christmas party
            with her, but he is still upset with her for her past with Viktor
            Krum. He makes out with Lavender Brown after a Quidditch match and
            starts going out with her instead. Harry attends the party with Luna
            Lovegood but eventually leaves when Draco Malfoy is found
            gatecrashing the event. Following the holidays, Ron is poisoned on
            his birthday after drinking mead originally meant as a gift for
            Dumbledore. He survives but is dumped by Lavender for spending more
            time with Hermione after the incident. Harry and Ginny begin dating
            during this time. Harry finally uses the Luck Potion ('Felix
            Felicis') to extract the unaltered memory from Slughorn. It reveals
            that Tom Riddle created six of the Horcruxes to make himself
            immortal. Horcruxes, magical objects encasing one's soul, are an
            ancient form of dark magic. Dumbledore believes two have already
            been destroyed but that at least four remain. He lists them to
            Harry, then summons him one evening, claiming to have found another.
            Together they journey to a cave, where a Horcrux is found to be
            hidden under protective enchantments in the middle of a lake.
            Dumbledore nearly dies retrieving the object, then returns with
            Harry to Hogwarts. Seeing the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower,
            the two ascend it. Hearing footsteps, Dumbledore puts a protective
            spell on Harry, who is forced to watch as Draco disarms Dumbledore
            silently. Draco claims responsibility for trying to kill Dumbledore,
            on Voldemort's orders, throughout the school year but cannot bring
            himself to do it now. Snape comes to the top of the tower and fires
            a Killing Curse at Dumbledore instead. Released from Dumbledore's
            protection, Harry chases after Snape and tries to use a spell on
            him, which Snape easily deflects. Harry is knocked down, and Snape
            taunts Harry for using his spells against him. He reveals himself to
            be the Half-Blood Prince, then escapes with Draco through the
            ensuing battle between Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix.
            Dumbledore's body is found at the bottom of the Astronomy Tower. His
            funeral is held on Hogwarts grounds and is attended by members of
            all wizarding races. Harry discovers that the Horcrux they retrieved
            was a fake and vows to find and destroy the remaining ones. Ron and
            Hermione promise to help him.

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Harry is about to turn seventeen and will lose his deceased mother's
            protection. Members of the Order of the Phoenix relocate the
            Dursleys, and prepare to move Harry to The Burrow by flying him
            there, using his friends as decoys. Death Eaters attack them upon
            departure, and in the ensuing battle, "Mad-Eye" Moody and Hedwig die
            while George Weasley is wounded. Voldemort arrives to kill Harry,
            whose wand fends off the attack. Harry, Ron, and Hermione prepare to
            hunt down Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. They each are given
            an object in Dumbledore's will: a Golden Snitch for Harry, a
            Deluminator for Ron, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard, for Hermione.
            Harry is also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, but the
            Ministry prevents him from receiving it. During Bill Weasley and
            Fleur Delacour's wedding, Death Eaters attack the reception while
            the Ministry of Magic falls to Voldemort. The trio flee to 12
            Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home that was left to Harry.
            They learn that Sirius's late brother, Regulus, stole the Horcrux
            locket but died in the process, and his house-elf Kreacher could not
            destroy it. It was later stolen by Mundungus Fletcher. Kreacher
            locates Fletcher, who says the locket was taken by Dolores Umbridge.
            Infiltrating the Ministry, the trio steal the locket from Umbridge,
            but Grimmauld Place is compromised in their escape. They hide in the
            forest, unable to destroy the locket and with no further leads. The
            locket's dark nature affects Ron, who abandons the group. Harry and
            Hermione learn about Dumbledore's past with dark wizard, Gellert
            Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace, and
            are attacked by Nagini who was disguised as Bathilda Bagshot. They
            escape, but Harry's wand is badly damaged. One night, a doe Patronus
            guides Harry to a pond containing the Sword of Godric Gryffindor.
            When Harry tries to recover it, the locket around his neck nearly
            kills him. Ron, guided back by the Deluminator, saves him and
            destroys the locket with the sword, in turn, destroying the Horcrux
            contained in it. In Dumbledore's book, Hermione identifies a symbol
            also worn by Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. When they
            visit him, he tells them of the mythical Deathly Hallows: the Elder
            Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which can summon
            the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. What Xenophilius
            does not say is that Luna has been captured. He summons Death Eaters
            to catch the trio in exchange for her freedom, but they escape. They
            figure out Dumbledore has the Elder Wand, which he won after
            defeating Grindelwald. Harry's Invisibility Cloak is the third
            Hallow, and his Snitch contains the Resurrection Stone. The trio are
            captured and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix tortures Hermione,
            believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her Gringotts vault.
            With help from Dobby the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's
            cottage along with fellow prisoners, including the goblin Griphook.
            During the escape, Bellatrix kills Dobby. Harry has a vision of
            Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. The trio
            decide to break into Bellatrix's vault, believing another Horcrux is
            there. With Griphook's help, they break in, retrieve Hufflepuff's
            cup, and escape, though Griphook steals Gryffindor's sword in the
            process. Harry has a vision of Voldemort being informed of the heist
            and deciding to check his Horcruxes, thus revealing the remaining
            ones to Harry: Nagini, and one hidden at Hogwarts. The trio enter
            Hogwarts with help from Dumbledore's brother Aberforth. Voldemort,
            alerted to Harry's whereabouts, mounts an assault on Hogwarts. The
            teachers and students mobilize to defend the school. Ron and
            Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with basilisk fangs from the
            Chamber of Secrets. Harry discovers Ravenclaw's diadem is the
            Horcrux. The trio find it in the Room of Requirement but are
            ambushed by Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. Crabbe attacks them using a
            cursed fire, but fails to control it; the fire kills him and
            destroys the diadem. Meanwhile, many die during Voldemort's assault,
            including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley. Voldemort
            feels the Elder Wand is not performing as expected. Believing that
            Snape, having killed Dumbledore, is its true master. Harry arrives
            as Voldemort kills Snape. Snape passes Harry memories to view in the
            Pensieve. They reveal Snape loved Harry's mother and acted as a
            double agent against Voldemort. He had watched over the trio,
            conjuring the doe Patronus. Dumbledore was dying after mishandling
            the ring Horcrux and had planned his "murder" at Snape's hands.
            Harry also learns he is an unintentional Horcrux, unbeknownst to
            Voldemort, and must die to render Voldemort mortal. Harry gives
            himself up, instructing Neville Longbottom to kill Nagini. On the
            way, he uses the Resurrection Stone to reunite with his parents and
            other deceased loved ones. He drops the stone as he meets Voldemort,
            who casts the Killing Curse on him. Harry awakens in a dreamlike
            location resembling King's Cross and is greeted by Dumbledore. He
            explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a fragment of
            his soul in Harry, causing their connection. The latest Killing
            Curse destroyed that soul fragment, allowing Harry to return to life
            or to "go on". Harry returns to life and feigns death. Voldemort
            calls for a truce at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. Neville,
            however, pulls Gryffindor's sword from the Sorting Hat and kills
            Nagini. The battle resumes, with Molly Weasley killing Bellatrix.
            Harry reveals himself to Voldemort and engages him in a final
            battle. He explains the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the
            defeat, not the killing, of its former master. Draco, not Snape, had
            been the Elder Wand's master, having disarmed Dumbledore before
            Snape killed him. Having disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry now
            commands the Elder Wand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at Harry,
            but the spell rebounds. Voldemort dies, and Harry repairs his
            original wand before returning the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb.
            He keeps his Invisibility Cloak and lets the Resurrection Stone
            remain lost. Epilogue Nineteen years later, the trio see their
            children off to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny have three children: James
            Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione have two
            children, Rose and Hugo. Harry's godson Teddy Lupin is found kissing
            Bill and Fleur's daughter Victoire; Draco and his wife are sending
            off their son Scorpius. Albus is departing for his first year and
            worries he will be placed in Slytherin. Harry reassures him, telling
            him of Snape's bravery, and revealing the Sorting Hat could account
            for his wishes. As his scar has not hurt in nineteen years, the
            narrator concludes that "all was well".
