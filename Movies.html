            <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors
            at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with
            groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver an orphaned infant wizard named
            Harry Potter to his Muggle aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon
            Dursley, his only living relatives. Ten years later, just before
            Harry's eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed
            to him. When the abusive Dursleys adamantly refuse to allow Harry to
            open any and flee to an island hut, Hagrid arrives to personally
            deliver Harry's letter of acceptance to Hogwarts. Hagrid also
            reveals that Harry's parents, James and Lily, were killed by a dark
            wizard named Lord Voldemort. The killing curse that Voldemort had
            cast towards Harry rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and giving
            Harry his lightning-bolt scar. Hagrid then takes Harry to Diagon
            Alley for school supplies and gives him a pet snowy owl whom he
            names Hedwig. Harry buys a wand that is connected to Voldemort's own
            wand. At King's Cross station, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express
            train, and meets fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger
            during the journey. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry also meets Draco
            Malfoy, who is from a wealthy wizard family; the two immediately
            form a rivalry. The students assemble in the Great Hall where the
            Sorting Hat sorts the first-years into four respective houses:
            Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is placed
            into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione, while Draco is placed
            into Slytherin, a house noted for dark wizards. As he studies magic,
            Harry learns more about his parents and Voldemort, and his natural
            talent for broomstick flying gets him recruited for Gryffindor's
            Quidditch team as the youngest Seeker in a century. While returning
            to the Gryffindor common room, the staircases change paths, leading
            Harry, Ron and Hermione to the third floor, which is forbidden to
            students. There they discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy.
            On Halloween, Ron insults Hermione after she shows off in Charms
            class; upset, she spends the entire afternoon crying in the girls'
            bathroom. That evening, a giant marauding troll enters it, but Harry
            and Ron save Hermione, and the three make up and become close
            friends after Hermione takes the blame for the incident by claiming
            she went looking for the troll. The trio discover that Fluffy is
            guarding the philosopher's stone, a magical object that can turn
            metal into gold and produce an immortality elixir. Harry suspects
            that Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House, Severus Snape,
            wants the stone to return Voldemort to physical form. When Hagrid
            accidentally reveals that music puts Fluffy asleep, Harry, Ron and
            Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape. Fluffy is already
            asleep, but the trio face other barriers, including a deadly plant
            called Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and
            a giant chess game that knocks out Ron. After overcoming the
            barriers, Harry encounters Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher
            Quirinus Quirrell who wants the stone; Snape had figured it out and
            had been protecting Harry. Quirrell removes his turban to reveal a
            weakened Voldemort living on the back of his head. Dumbledore's
            protective enchantment places the stone in Harry's possession.
            Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for
            resurrecting his parents, but Harry sees through his trick and
            refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry. When Harry touches
            Quirrell's skin, it burns Quirrell, reducing him to ashes.
            Voldemort's soul rises from the pile and escapes, knocking out Harry
            as it passes through him. Harry recovers in the school infirmary.
            Dumbledore tells him the stone has been destroyed to prevent misuse,
            and that Ron and Hermione are safe. He also reveals how Harry
            defeated Quirrell: when Lily died to save Harry, a love-based
            protection against Voldemort was placed on him. At the
            end-of-school-year feast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded
            extra house points for their heroism, tying Gryffindor for first
            place with Slytherin; Dumbledore then awards ten points to their
            housemate Neville Longbottom for having had the courage to stand up
            to the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns to the
            Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home at
            Hogwarts

            <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Spending the summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter meets Dobby, a
            house-elf who warns him that it is dangerous to return to Hogwarts.
            Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock up
            Harry to prevent his return to Hogwarts. Harry's friend Ron Weasley
            and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father's flying
            car. In Diagon Alley, Harry, the Weasleys and Hermione Granger
            notice a book-signing by Gilderoy Lockhart, Hogwarts' new Defence
            Against the Dark Arts teacher. There, Harry sees Draco Malfoy's
            father, Lucius, slip a book into Ginny Weasley's cauldron. After
            being blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at
            King's Cross railway station, Harry and Ron take the car to
            Hogwarts. There, they crash into the Whomping Willow, breaking Ron's
            wand, and receive detention. In detention, Harry hears a strange
            voice and later finds caretaker Argus Filch's cat, Mrs Norris,
            petrified beside a message written in blood: "The Chamber of Secrets
            has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware." One of Hogwarts'
            founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber
            containing a monster that only his heir can control, capable of
            purging the school of Muggle-born students. To solve this mystery,
            Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question Malfoy, using polyjuice
            potion, which they brew in a bathroom haunted by Moaning Myrtle, a
            ghost. During a Quidditch game, Harry's arm is broken by a rogue
            Bludger. Dobby visits him in the infirmary and reveals that he
            closed the barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and made the
            Bludger chase Harry to force him to leave the school. He also
            reveals that the Chamber had been opened in the past. When Harry
            communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the heir.
            Disguised as two of Malfoy's friends, Harry and Ron learn he is not
            the heir, but come to know that a Muggle-born girl died when the
            Chamber was last opened. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by
            former student Tom Riddle, who opened the Chamber and blamed Rubeus
            Hagrid, leading to his expulsion. When the diary is stolen and
            Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. Professor
            Dumbledore, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and Lucius arrive to
            take Hagrid to Azkaban, but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow
            the spiders". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's
            giant pet spider, Aragog, who reveals Hagrid's innocence. A book
            page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a basilisk, a
            giant serpent that kills people who make direct eye contact with it;
            the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff
            learns Ginny has been taken into the Chamber, and nominate Lockhart
            to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart preparing to flee, exposing
            him as a fraud. Deducing that Myrtle was the Muggle-born girl that
            the basilisk killed, they find the Chamber's entrance in the
            bathroom she haunts. Once inside, Lockhart tries to stop Harry and
            Ron by using a memory charm. However, because he seized Ron's broken
            wand, the spell backfires, erasing Lockhart's memory and causing a
            cave-in that separates Harry from Ron and Lockhart. Harry enters the
            Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle
            turns out to be Slytherin's heir and Voldemort's younger self. He
            used the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber. After
            Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, the latter's pet phoenix
            Fawkes arrives with the Sorting Hat, causing Riddle to summon the
            basilisk. Fawkes blinds the basilisk, and the Sorting Hat produces
            the Sword of Gryffindor, with which Harry battles the basilisk.
            After a struggle, he kills it but is poisoned by one of its fangs.
            Despite his injury, Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang,
            destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Fawkes' tears heal Harry, who
            returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart, earning
            Dumbledore's praise and Hagrid's release. Harry accuses Lucius,
            Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and
            tricks him into freeing Dobby. The basilisk's victims are healed,
            Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from
            Azkaban

            <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>
          Harry Potter spends another dissatisfying summer with the Dursleys. On
          his thirteenth birthday, Vernon's visiting sister Marge viciously
          insults Harry and his parents, and an angry Harry causes her to
          inflate and float away. Expecting to be expelled for using magic
          outside school, Harry flees with his belongings. The Knight Bus takes
          Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge
          assures Harry that he will not be punished. Reuniting with his best
          friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius
          Black, a convicted supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban
          Prison and intends to kill him. During the journey to Hogwarts, the
          Hogwarts Express is boarded by Dementors, ghostly prison guards
          searching for Black. One enters Harry's compartment, causing him to
          faint, but new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin
          repels it with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, Headmaster Albus
          Dumbledore announces that Dementors will patrol the school until Black
          is captured. Rubeus Hagrid is appointed Care of Magical Creatures
          teacher, but his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy provokes a
          Hippogriff named Buckbeak into attacking him, and his father, Lucius,
          has Buckbeak sentenced to death. Returning to Gryffindor Tower, the
          students find the Fat Lady's portrait has been attacked, and the
          terrified Fat Lady warns Dumbledore that Black entered the castle.
          During a stormy Quidditch match, Dementors cause Harry to fall off his
          broomstick, which is destroyed by the Whomping Willow. He is caught
          trying to visit Hogsmeade by Fred and George, who give him the
          Marauder's Map. Using the map, Harry sneaks into Hogsmeade and learns
          that Black is his godfather, but divulged the Potters' whereabouts to
          Voldemort and murdered their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew. Determined
          to ward off the Dementors, Harry convinces Lupin to teach him the
          Patronus Charm. After Divination class, he witnesses Professor
          Trelawney enter a trance and prophesies that the Dark Lord will
          return. Watching Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat Scabbers bites
          him and escapes, but a large black dog drags them both into a hole at
          the base of the Whomping Willow. This leads the trio through an
          underground passage into the Shrieking Shack, where the dog is
          revealed to be Black, an Animagus who can transform into an animal.
          Lupin appears, embracing Black as an old friend before revealing
          himself to be a werewolf. Snape arrives to apprehend Black, but is
          knocked out by Harry's Disarming spell. Lupin and Black reveal that
          Scabbers is actually the Animagus form of Pettigrew, who betrayed
          Harry's parents, faked his death and framed Black for his own crimes.
          Turning Pettigrew back into human form, the group heads back to the
          castle, but the full moon causes Lupin to transform and Pettigrew
          escapes. As Black fights off Lupin in their animal forms, Dementors
          attack Black and Harry, but an unseen figure casts a powerful
          Patronus. Harry falls unconscious, awakening in the infirmary with
          Dumbledore and Hermione. Learning that Black has been captured and
          sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss, Harry and Hermione act on
          Dumbledore's advice and use Hermione's Time-Turner, which she was
          given to attend several classes at once, to go three hours back in
          time. They see themselves reliving the night's events, and set
          Buckbeak free from execution. Spotting the past Harry and Black being
          attacked by Dementors, Harry rescues them using a Patronus charm and
          realizes he was the unseen figure who saved them earlier. He and
          Hermione free Black, who flies away on Buckbeak, still a fugitive
          without proof of his innocence. Harry and Hermione return to the
          infirmary, rejoining their own timeline. Exposed as a werewolf, Lupin
          resigns from teaching and returns the Marauder's Map to Harry. Black
          sends Harry a Firebolt broomstick, which he happily takes on a ride.
